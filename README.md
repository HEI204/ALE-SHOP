#### Description:
It is my final project for CS50 which is web application about online shopping site using Flask to develop. For this website, it requires all customers to create their own account first in order to buy the product on the site. After the user have created their own account, it will provide $200000 to the account by default. Then the user can use the money to buy the product that they would like to buy via add to the cart and purchase it if they have enough money.
